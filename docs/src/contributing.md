# Contributing

The BioJulia organisation has a set of contribution guidelines which apply to
all BioJulia projects. These guidelines are available [here](https://github.com/BioJulia/Contributing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and it is
recommended all new contributors read these guidelines before opening a pull
request.

## Making a contribution

If you're interested in adding functionality to Microbiome.jl, please feel free
to open an issue or a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch. If you're
not yet ready for that, you can also ask questions/start a discussion in the `#biology` channel on [slack or zulip](https://julialang.org/community/), or using the [`biology` domain on discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/bio/). 

Work-in-progress PRs are fine, as discussion about approach and code review
can happen in the PR.

Before merging, any new code should be unit tested and have docs for newly
exported functions, but if you don't know how to do this, don't worry, we can
help!
